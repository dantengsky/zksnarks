Compuational Complexity of ZK-snarks
=== 

## Performance and Security boosts in implementation of zk-snarks  
- Parallelizing Polynomial multiplication via fft in log(n) time
- Use of architecutres like CUDA and FPGA to accelerate computations 
- Acceleration of crypto-primitives 
- Let user build his own trusted setup via leveraging the cloud, kubernetes and gpu instances.
