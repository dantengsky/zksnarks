ZK-snarks in english 
=== 

`Zk-snarks` are a class of Zero Knowledge proofs, with a property that they can be efficiently represented and computed on modern hardware. SNARKs
is succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge. 

In this short guide, we will try to understand the `problem at hand`, and how zk-snarks help us solve that problem. Furthermore we will try to examine various cryptographic constructions it borrows from the field and their limitations.
